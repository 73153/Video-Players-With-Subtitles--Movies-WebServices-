<b>Who We Are</b>

00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:16,244
The Engineering Team at Viki works on developing and maintaining the backend behind viki.com - a global TV site powered by a volunteer community of avid fans.

00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:18,603
Launched in December 2010, we have over 2 billion video streams and more than 400 million words translated.

00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:22,369
We are not obsessed by any particular technology.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,760
We believe cool technologies might not get the job done, the right technologies do.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,740
We use Ruby, Node.js, Golang, AngularJS, EmberJS with PostgreSQL, Redis and RabbitMQ.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,195
We make sure our code are highly decoupled through message queue infrastructure, service-oriented architectures and proper design patterns.
